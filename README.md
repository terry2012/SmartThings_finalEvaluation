# SmartThings_finalEvaluation

We have figured out almost all kinds of the possible attacks on existing SmartThings system.

## Attention:

These attacks are the basis of our evluation for our paper which involve many sensitive info. So, I could not publicize them now. But I would update the attack code after our paper submits to NDSS 2016! 

If you want to know about the details of these attacks, please feel free to contact me~
